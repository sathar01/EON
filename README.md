# EON
# EON Forecasting Challenge
This is the repo for saving EON data files and python script<\n>
The latest jupyter notebook is "EON_Forecast_Model.ipynb"
The consumption data is of huge size and hence I had to split that into 5 smaller files.
"EON Notebook.ipynb" is for understanding and analyzing various datasets shared by EON.
